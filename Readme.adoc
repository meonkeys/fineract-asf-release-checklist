.Checklist for closing gaps between the https://fineract.apache.org[Fineract] release process and the https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html[official Apache Release Policy]
****
* [ ] Perform *official* release.
** [ ] Release mangager builds release candidate tarballs. FIXME
** [ ] Binding voters https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#release-approval[approve release candidate].
*** [ ] Download bin, src, checksums, signature onto own hardware.
*** [ ] https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#artifacts[Verify artifacts meet ASF policy requirements].
*** [ ] Validate all cryptographic signatures.
*** [ ] Compile as provided.
*** [ ] Test the result (build product) on own platform.
* [ ] Use https://infra.apache.org/release-distribution.html#channels[official release distribution channel] -- `downloads.apache.org`.
* [ ] Ensure https://fineract.apache.org/#downloads links to official mirrored release artifacts.
* [ ] Delete https://github.com/apache/fineract/releases[GitHub release assets] to https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#what[avoid use of unapproved source and build artifacts]. See also: https://infra.apache.org/release-distribution.html#unreleased[Distribution of unreleased materials].
* [ ] Collapse multiple sources of truth for what's in Fineract releases: JIRA, GitHub releases, Confluence.
****

.Other recommendations
****
* [ ] Use https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#downloads[official release metrics] instead of https://scarf.sh[Scarf] for download statistics.
* [ ] Ping ASF infra team prior to releases https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#heads-up[since they are > 300MB].
* [ ] Use https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#release-types[official release naming convention]: "Test Packages", "Nightly Builds", "Release Candidates", "Releases".
* [ ] Update Releases section on https://projects.apache.org/project.html?fineract[Project Information page] by updating Fineract's https://github.com/ewilderj/doap[DOAP RDF] (add a task for this in JIRA and Fineract Release Plugin `buildSrc/` code).
