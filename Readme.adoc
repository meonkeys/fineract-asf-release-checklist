Recommendations for improving Fineract releases based on recent release engineering conversations.
I don't believe the goal with Fineract 1.10.1 and 1.11 releases will be to strictly meet/exceed every ASF policy, but rather to do the best we can, continue to improve, and be transparent about any gaps.

.Checklist for closing gaps between the https://fineract.apache.org[Fineract] release process and the https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html[official Apache Release Policy]
****
* [ ] Perform *official* release.
** [ ] Binding voters https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#release-approval[approve release candidate].
*** [ ] Download bin, src, checksums, signature onto own hardware.
*** [ ] https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#artifacts[Verify artifacts meet ASF policy requirements].
*** [ ] Validate all cryptographic signatures.
*** [ ] Compile as provided.
*** [ ] Test the result (build product) on own platform.
* [ ] Use https://infra.apache.org/release-distribution.html#channels[official release distribution channel] -- `downloads.apache.org`.
* [ ] Ensure https://fineract.apache.org/#downloads links to official mirrored release artifacts.
* [ ] Update https://downloads.apache.org/fineract/KEYS -- add James's new PGP key
* [ ] Collapse multiple sources of truth for what's in Fineract releases: JIRA, GitHub releases, Confluence.
* [ ] https://infra.apache.org/release-distribution.html#sigs-and-sums[Discontinue MD5 checksums].
****

.Other recommendations
****
* [ ] Ping ASF infra team prior to releases https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#heads-up[since they are > 300MB].
* [ ] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-2158[ensure every PR on GitHub references a Fineract JIRA ticket]
* [ ] Use https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#release-types[official release naming convention]: "Test Packages", "Nightly Builds", "Release Candidates", "Releases".
* [ ] Update Releases section on https://projects.apache.org/project.html?fineract[Project Information page] by updating Fineract's https://github.com/ewilderj/doap[DOAP RDF] (add a task for this in JIRA and Fineract Release Plugin `buildSrc/` code).
* [ ] Use https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#downloads[official release metrics] and/or https://analytics.apache.org[ASF-hosted Matomo] instead of https://scarf.sh[Scarf] for download statistics.
** [x] Note https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/FSIP-2+Scarf+Data+Tracking[Fineract PMC Scarf research and decision]
